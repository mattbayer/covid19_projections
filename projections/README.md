# Projections Data

Here, you will find the raw data for our [covid19-projections.com](https://covid19-projections.com) projections, ordered by the date the projections were generated. Under each date directory, you will find a .csv file for each individual state/region/country. You can also look under our `combined` directory to see all of our daily projections combined in a single file. The directories are further subdivided by global countries and subregions (US counties and Canadian provinces).

# Column Descriptions

* `actual_deaths` - Daily deaths as reported by [Johns Hopkins University CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)
* `total_deaths` - Cumulative deaths as reported by Johns Hopkins University CSSE
* `predicted_deaths_mean`, `predicted_deaths_lower`, `predicted_deaths_upper` - Mean, 2.5th, and 97.5th percentile of our daily deaths projections
* `predicted_total_deaths_mean`, `predicted_total_deaths_lower`, `predicted_total_deaths_upper` (Since 2020-04-02) - Mean, 2.5th, and 97.5th percentile of our cumulative deaths projections
* `predicted_new_infected_mean`, `predicted_new_infected_lower`, `predicted_new_infected_upper` (Since 2020-04-08) - Mean, 2.5th, and 97.5th percentile of our estimates for the total number of newly infected individuals on that day. This is based on the date an individual is *first exposed*. Note that these estimates include all infections, not just those who tested positive.
* `predicted_current_infected_mean`, `predicted_current_infected_lower`, `predicted_current_infected_upper` (Since 2020-04-08) - Mean, 2.5th, and 97.5th percentile of our estimates for the total number of individuals that are infected on that day. This is the sum of the past 15 days of newly infected individuals
* `predicted_total_infected_mean`, `predicted_total_infected_lower`, `predicted_total_infected_upper` (Since 2020-04-08) - Mean, 2.5th, and 97.5th percentile of our estimates for the total number of individuals that have ever been infected. This is the cumulative sum of the newly infected individuals
* `r_values_mean` (since 2020-05-15), `r_values_lower` (since 2020-07-30), `r_values_upper` (since 2020-07-30) - Mean, lower and upper bound estimates of the Rt value on that day. Starting on 2020-08-24, we began including Rt estimates for the future as well. Note that our Rt lower and upper bounds tend to be on the narrow side.

# Notes

* Projections in this repository are rounded to the nearest integer, and hence is missing decimal precision. To avoid rounding errors, we recommend using the cumulative deaths to perform computations on incident deaths (e.g. weekly incident deaths).

* Our estimates from early April do not incorporate reopenings and probable deaths, two factors that significantly increases the estimates. Furthermore, our April 1-7 projections only go through June 30. Starting on April 8, our projections were extended to August 4.

* Our first projections on April 1 do not have an upper/lower bound.

* We added estimates of infected individuals starting on April 8.

* We added estimates of the R_t value starting on May 15.

* We send projections to the CDC every Monday using Sunday's data. For example, April 26, May 3, May 10, May 17, etc. As a result, we recommend using those projections for evaluation, since those have the highest impact and were the most carefully vetted. See our [open source evaluation](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19-forecast-hub-evaluation).
