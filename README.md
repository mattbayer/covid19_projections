**2020-10-06 Update:** Projections dated 2020-10-04 was our last model update. For more information, read [Youyang Gu's blog post](https://youyanggu.com/blog/six-months-later). Follow [@youyanggu](https://twitter.com/youyanggu) on Twitter for continued COVID-19 insights. Thank you for your support over the past year.

We take a data-driven approach rooted in epidemiology to forecast infections and deaths for the COVID-19 / coronavirus epidemic in the US and around the world.

## Description of Folders

You can click on each folder to view the README for that folder.

* [`c19pro_score`](/c19pro_score) - Raw data for our [C19Pro Score](https://covid19-projections.com/maps/#c19pro-score)
* [`implied_ifr`](/implied_ifr) - Implied Infection Fatality Rate (IIFR) estimates
* [`projections`](/projections) - Raw daily projections generated by our model
* [`r_values`](/r_values) - Reproduction number (R) estimates
* [`reich_forecasts`](/reich_forecasts) - Reich forecasts follow the format specified by the [Reich Lab](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub)
* [`tests_target`](/tests_target) - Testing targets for every region based on our forecasts

The underlying SEIR simulator used to generate these projections is open source: https://github.com/youyanggu/yyg-seir-simulator. The simulator repository also includes the best learned values of [the various parameters](https://github.com/youyanggu/yyg-seir-simulator#parameters) for every region.

Our projections are featured on the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html).

We have also open-sourced our evaluation of our model and other CDC models: https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19-forecast-hub-evaluation.
