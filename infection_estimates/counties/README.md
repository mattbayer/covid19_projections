# US County-level Infection Estimates

Due to the large file sizes of county-level infection estimates (~250MB), we have moved the data to its own repository: https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19-infection-estimates-counties.

Please visit the repo above to access county-level estimates. The estimates are updated daily.
